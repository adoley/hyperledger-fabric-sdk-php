# Hyperledger Fabric Client SDK for PHP
- - - - - - - - 

Welcome to PHP SDK for Hyperledger project. The main objective of this SDK is to facilitate a client to perform basic chaincode related operations like: creating a channel, installing and accessing a chaincode etc.

Note, the fabric-sdk-php is a standalone client side interface to access the network information and ledger data over running blockchain network, it cannot be used as a persistence medium for application defined channels data.

## Installation
```
composer require americanexpress/hyperledger-fabric-sdk-php
```

## Usage

Below, you will find high-level and concise snippets of code demonstrating how to interact with this SDK.

### Channel::queryByChaincode
Query first peer in first organization (default behavior):
```php
$config = new \AmericanExpress\HyperledgerFabricClient\Config\ClientConfig([
    // See `test/integration/config.php` for an example.
]);
$response = \AmericanExpress\HyperledgerFabricClient\Client\ClientFactory::fromConfig($config)
    ->getChannel('foo')
    ->getChaincode('example_cc')
    ->invoke('query', 'a');
```

Query specific organization:
```php
$config = new \AmericanExpress\HyperledgerFabricClient\Config\ClientConfig([
    // See `test/integration/config.php` for an example.
]);
$response = \AmericanExpress\HyperledgerFabricClient\Client\ClientFactory::fromConfig($config, 'peerOrg1')
    ->getChannel('foo')
    ->getChaincode('example_cc')
    ->invoke('query', 'a');
```

Query specific organization and peer:
```php
$config = new \AmericanExpress\HyperledgerFabricClient\Config\ClientConfig([
    // See `test/integration/config.php` for an example.
]);
$options = new \AmericanExpress\HyperledgerFabricClient\Transaction\TransactionOptions([
    'peer' => 'peer1',
]);
$response = \AmericanExpress\HyperledgerFabricClient\Client\ClientFactory::fromConfig($config, 'peerOrg1')
    ->getChannel('foo')
    ->getChaincode('example_cc')
    ->invoke('query', 'a', $options);
```

Query chaincode by path and version:
```php
$config = new \AmericanExpress\HyperledgerFabricClient\Config\ClientConfig([
    // See `test/integration/config.php` for an example.
]);
$response = \AmericanExpress\HyperledgerFabricClient\Client\ClientFactory::fromConfig($config)
    ->getChannel('foo')
    ->getChaincode(['name' => 'example_cc', 'version' => '1', 'path' => 'github.com/example_cc'])
    ->invoke('query', 'a');
```

## Phase 1

* For phase 1, we are providing client access for basic chaincode operations like query by chain code.
* Itâ€™s assumed that we have a running blockchain network, with a predefined channel and an installed chaincode.
* A [predefined script](test/fixture/sdkintegration/docker-compose.yaml) is provided to bring up the test network as per the test cases.

## Phase 2 (Upcoming)

* In next release we are targeting to add more chaincode operations like create channel, invoke & install etc

## Latest builds of Fabric and Fabric-ca v1.1.0

Hyperledger Fabric v1.1.0 is currently under active development.

You can clone these projects by going to the [Hyperledger repository](https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/admin/projects/).

### Prerequisites ###

#### [Docker version ^17.0](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation)
Check version of Docker:
```bash
docker --version
```

#### [PHP version ^7.1](http://php.net/manual/en/install.php)
Check version of PHP:
```bash
php --version
```

#### [PHP GMP extension](http://php.net/manual/en/gmp.installation.php)
Check PHP-GMP setup in php.ini

#### [Composer tool](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md)
Check composer version (it should be 1.5 or plus)
```bash
composer --version
```

### Installing SDK (for development)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/americanexpress/hyperledger-fabric-sdk-php && cd $_
composer update
```

### Generating SDK API Documentation

```php
composer docs
```

```bash
open build/docs/index.html
```

### Running the End2End test case

Before running the tests, we need to bring up the fabric network and fixture(s):
```bash
composer fixture:up
```

At present, we are providing example test case for Querying a chaincode, which can be run as below:
```bash
composer test:integration
```

After running the tests, feel free to bring down the fabric network:
```bash
composer fixture:down
```

## Regenerating PHP Class files from `.proto` files

```bash
composer protoc
```
