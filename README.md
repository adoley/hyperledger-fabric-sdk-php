# Hyperledger Fabric Client SDK for PHP
- - - - - - - - 

Welcome to PHP SDK for Hyperledger project. The main objective of this SDK is to facilitate a client to perform basic chaincode related operations like: creating a channel, installing and accessing a chaincode etc.

Note, the fabric-sdk-php is a standalone client side interface to access the network information and ledger data over running blockchain network, it cannot be used as a persistence medium for application defined channels data.

## Installation
```
composer require americanexpress/hyperledger-fabric-sdk-php
```

## Usage

Below, you will find high-level and concise snippets of code demonstrating how to interact with this SDK.

### Channel::queryByChaincode
Query first peer in first organization (default behavior):
```php
$config = new \AmericanExpress\HyperledgerFabricClient\Config\ClientConfig([
    // See `test/integration/config.php` for an example.
]);
$response = \AmericanExpress\HyperledgerFabricClient\Client\ClientFactory::fromConfig($config)
    ->getChannel('foo')
    ->getChaincode('example_cc')
    ->invoke('query', 'a');
```

Query specific organization:
```php
$config = new \AmericanExpress\HyperledgerFabricClient\Config\ClientConfig([
    // See `test/integration/config.php` for an example.
]);
$response = \AmericanExpress\HyperledgerFabricClient\Client\ClientFactory::fromConfig($config, 'peerOrg1')
    ->getChannel('foo')
    ->getChaincode('example_cc')
    ->invoke('query', 'a');
```

Query specific organization and peer:
```php
$config = new \AmericanExpress\HyperledgerFabricClient\Config\ClientConfig([
    // See `test/integration/config.php` for an example.
]);
$options = new \AmericanExpress\HyperledgerFabricClient\Transaction\TransactionOptions([
    'peer' => 'peer1',
]);
$response = \AmericanExpress\HyperledgerFabricClient\Client\ClientFactory::fromConfig($config, 'peerOrg1')
    ->getChannel('foo')
    ->getChaincode('example_cc')
    ->invoke('query', 'a', $options);
```

Query chaincode by path and version:
```php
$config = new \AmericanExpress\HyperledgerFabricClient\Config\ClientConfig([
    // See `test/integration/config.php` for an example.
]);
$response = \AmericanExpress\HyperledgerFabricClient\Client\ClientFactory::fromConfig($config)
    ->getChannel('foo')
    ->getChaincode(['name' => 'example_cc', 'version' => '1', 'path' => 'github.com/example_cc'])
    ->invoke('query', 'a');
```

## Phase 1

* For phase 1, we are providing client access for basic chaincode operations like query by chain code.
* Itâ€™s under assumption that we have a running blockchain network, with a predefined channel and an installed chaincode.
* A predefined script is provided to bring up the test network as per the test cases.



## Phase 2 (Upcoming)

* In next release we are targeting to add more chaincode operations like create channel, invoke & install etc


## Latest builds of Fabric and Fabric-ca v1.1.0

Hyperledger Fabric v1.1.0 is currently under active development.

### Prerequisites ###

#### [Latest Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation)
Check docker version (it should be 17+)

`docker --version`


#### [PHP version 7+](http://php.net/manual/en/install.php)
Check version of PHP

`php --version`


#### [PHP GMP extension](http://php.net/manual/en/gmp.installation.php)
Check PHP-GMP setup in php.ini


#### [Composer tool](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md)
Check composer version (it should be 1.5 or plus)

`composer --version`




### Installing SDK (for development)


`git clone {fabric-sdk-php}`

`cd fabric-sdk-php`

`composer install`




### Running the End2End test case


Before running the tests, we need to bring up the fabric network and fixture(s):
```bash
(cd ./test/fixture/sdkintegration && docker-compose up -d)
```

Stream the logs:
```bash
(cd ./test/fixture/sdkintegration && docker-compose logs -f)
```

At present we are providing example test case for Querying a chaincode, which can be run as below:
```bash
./vendor/bin/phpunit
```

After running the tests, you can bring down the fabric network:
```bash
(cd ./test/fixture/sdkintegration && docker-compose down)
```

## Regenerating PHP Class files from `.proto` files

```bash
composer protoc
```
