# Hyperledger Fabric Client SDK for PHP

Welcome to Java SDK for Hyperledger project. The main objective of this SDK is to facilitate a client to perform basic chaincode related operations like: creating a channel, installing and accessing a chaincode etc.

Note, the fabric-sdk-php is a standlone client side interface to access the network information and ledger data over running blockchain network, it can not be used as a persistance medium for application defined channels data.

## Assumptions

* For phase -1 we are targetting to provide client access for basic chaincode operations like: invoke, query etc.
* Its under assumption that we have a running blockchain network, with a predefined channel and an installed chaincode.
* A predefined script is provided to bring up the test network as per the test cases.
